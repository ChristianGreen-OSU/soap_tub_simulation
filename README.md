### üí° Simulation Concepts

Each timestep simulates water interacting with the soap bar's surface. Erosion depends on:

* **Flow vector**: the direction of water (e.g., `[0, 0, -1]` for top-down)
* **Erosion rate**: how much material is lost per timestep
* **Stochastic/deterministic**: should erosion be smooth or noisy?
* **Geometry**: ellipsoid, cuboid, rounded edges, etc.
* **Voxel model**: just like reactor lattice meshing

> Inspired by lattice-based models in **OpenMC**, **RELAP5**, and CRUD buildup tracking in real reactors.

### üß† How It Works

* **Voxel model** tracks soap as a 3D grid: `grid[x, y, z] ‚àà [0, 1]`
* **Flow vector** sets direction; center is projected *upstream*
* **Surface detection** uses integer-based neighbor detection to find outer shell
* **Exposure** is computed via vector dot product: `dot(normal, flow_vector)`
* **Erosion engine** subtracts value from each voxel over time
* **Visualization** uses PyVista to animate voxel decay

conda install imageio
```
or
```bash
python -m venv soap_env
.\soap_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ 2. Run Simulation

```bash
python main.py
```
For Svelte Web UI:
```bash
python flask_app.py
```
```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

It will:

# üßº Soap Erosion Model ‚Äî Mathematical Summary

### 1. Geometry and Grid Representation

The soap bar is discretized into a 3D voxel grid:

$$
\mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_x \times N_y \times N_z}
$$

Each voxel $G_{i,j,k} \in [0,1]$ represents local soap density (intactness).

---

### 2. Flow-Aligned Water Source (Center Reference)

The shifted center point is placed upstream of the soap volume:

$$
\mathbf{c} = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
N_x \\
N_y \\
N_z
\end{bmatrix}
- \hat{\mathbf{v}}_{\text{flow}} \cdot d_{\text{offset}}
$$

* $\hat{\mathbf{v}}_{\text{flow}}$: normalized incoming water direction
* $d_{\text{offset}}$: scalar distance upstream from soap center

---

### 3. Directional Exposure (All Models)

For a voxel at position $\mathbf{p}$, its surface normal is approximated as the vector from the erosion center:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{c}}{\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{c}\|}
$$

Directional exposure to water flow is calculated as:

$$
E = \max(0, \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}}_{\text{flow}})
$$

This is the cosine of the angle between the voxel-facing vector and the water direction.

---

### 4. Deterministic Erosion Model

Each exposed voxel loses mass according to:

$$
\Delta m = E \cdot r
$$

Where:

* $r$: erosion rate per timestep (user-defined constant)

---

### 5. Stochastic Erosion Model

A fraction $f$ of exposed voxels is selected, biased by exposure:

$$
k = \lfloor N \cdot f \rfloor, \quad p_i = \frac{E_i}{\sum_j E_j}
$$

Each selected voxel is eroded by a random amount:

$$
\Delta m_i = E_i \cdot \max(0, \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2))
$$

* $\mu$: mean erosion
* $\sigma$: erosion variability (standard deviation)
* $\mathcal{N}$: normal distribution

---
### 6. Determine Surface Voxels
Surface voxels are determined by checking if a voxel containing soap is **exposed** to air or empty space in any of the six orthogonal directions.

---

#### 1. Binary Mask of Soap Presence

Let $G \in \mathbb{R}^{N_x \times N_y \times N_z}$ be the 3D voxel grid. First, construct a binary mask $M$:

$$
M_{i,j,k} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } G_{i,j,k} > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

---

#### 2. Morphological Erosion (Interior Detection)

Erode the binary mask using a 6-connected kernel $K$ (only axial neighbors):

$$
E = M \ominus K
$$

This gives a mask of **interior** voxels ‚Äî those fully surrounded by other soap voxels.

---

#### 3. Surface Mask Calculation

Now, subtract the interior from the full mask:

$$
S = M - E
$$

This yields a surface mask $S$, where:

$$
S_{i,j,k} = 1 \quad \text{means voxel } (i,j,k) \text{ is on the surface}
$$

---

#### 4. Directionally Exposed Surface Voxels

We optionally refine this based on the **flow direction** $\vec{v}_{\text{flow}}$:

$$
\text{exposed}(\vec{p}) =
\begin{cases}
\text{True} & \text{if } G(\vec{p}) > 0 \text{ and } G(\vec{p} + \text{round}(\vec{v}_{\text{flow}})) \leq 0 \\
\text{True} & \text{if neighbor is out of bounds} \\
\text{False} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This gives the set of voxels that are both on the surface and **facing into the incoming water flow**.

---



### 7. Mass Tracking & Summary Metrics

Total soap mass at timestep $t$:

$$
M_t = \sum_{i,j,k} G_{i,j,k}
$$

Useful diagnostics:

* **Total mass lost**:

  $$
  M_0 - M_T
  $$

* **Average erosion rate**:

  $$
  \frac{M_0 - M_T}{T}
  $$

* **Half-mass time** (first timestep where $M_t \leq \frac{M_0}{2}$)

# Engineering Review & Analysis

## Water Drop Modeling

### 1. How are water drops encoded?

#### 1.1 How is the mass and velocity of each drop defined?

Water drops are not modeled as individual particles. Instead, a vector `flow_vector` represents the direction of water flow, and a scalar `erosion_rate` (or statistical mean and standard deviation) encodes the magnitude of erosion over time.

#### 1.2 Are drops modeled individually or in bulk?

Drops are modeled in bulk. The simulation uses a volumetric (Eulerian-style) approach, where erosion is applied to exposed surface voxels as a field operation rather than simulating individual droplets.

#### 1.3 Does the model correctly identify collisions with soap cells?

Yes. The `get_exposed_surface_voxels()` method checks whether each surface voxel has an upstream neighbor (in the flow direction) that is empty, indicating exposure to incoming flow. This approximates collision detection based on flow access.

---

## Physical Effects of Erosion

### 2. What happens when a drop collides with a soap cell?

#### 2.1 Which physical effects are modeled?

Only erosion is modeled. Dissolution, evaporation, and fluid dynamics are not explicitly included. Erosion is handled in two ways:

* In deterministic mode, erosion is proportional to the dot product between the flow vector and the voxel's direction from the source (i.e., directional exposure).
* In stochastic mode, erosion amounts are drawn from a normal distribution and biased toward voxels more exposed to the flow.

#### 2.2 Are these processes deterministic or stochastic?

Both approaches are supported. The deterministic model resembles fixed field erosion (like coolant flow in reactor modeling), while the stochastic model reflects uncertainty and randomness (similar to Monte Carlo transport or CRUD flaking).

---

## Spatial Interactions and System Limits

### 3. How do adjacent soap cells interact?

There is no explicit coupling between adjacent voxels. Erosion is applied locally to each voxel based on its surface exposure. However, erosion indirectly changes the geometry over time, which affects what becomes exposed, introducing an emergent spatial dynamic.

### 4. What is the final state as drops approach infinity?

As the number of erosion steps increases, total soap mass approaches zero. In deterministic cases, this results in a smooth wedge-like erosion pattern just before zero. In stochastic cases, some parts may persist longer due to random selection, but the final state still trends toward full dissolution.

---

## Modeling Strategy and Engineering Practice

### Simulation Approach

### 1. How is a generic simulation task approached?

#### 1.1 Physical to computational representation

Soap is discretized into a 3D voxel grid. Water is abstracted as a directional field. This mirrors how neutron flux, coolant flow, or power distributions are represented in nuclear reactor simulations.

#### 1.2 Communication of modeling choices

Modeling decisions are made explicit in code, comments, visualizations, and configuration files. Debugging tools help verify flow alignment and erosion behavior at each step.

---

## Architecture and Implementation

### 2. What modeling architecture was chosen?

#### 2.1 Why this architecture?

The voxel grid supports both spatial discretization and geometric flexibility. The choice of a field-based erosion model (as opposed to a particle system) is aligned with how heat, stress, or CRUD models work in real simulation codes.

#### 2.2 Code elegance and clarity

Erosion logic, geometry definition, visualization, and configuration are all modular. This allows deterministic and stochastic models to reuse core components.

#### 2.3 Performance tradeoffs

Erosion logic is simple and clear but not yet vectorized for maximum speed. Voxel-level simulation scales well up to \~100√ó100√ó50, with potential for GPU optimization later.

---

## Model Development and Testing

### 3. What was prioritized during model construction?

#### 3.1 Critical functionality

Surface detection, erosion application, and mass tracking were implemented first. These are foundational for validating correctness and conservation behavior.

#### 3.2 Nice-to-have features

GIF animations, interactive debugging overlays, alternate geometries, and stochastic modeling were layered in after the core erosion loop was validated.

---

## Assumption Validation

### 4. How were assumptions validated?

* Debug visualizations overlay flow vectors and exposure planes on the soap model
* Mass is logged over time to detect plateaus or anomalies
* Visual inspection of erosion patterns confirms alignment with flow direction
* Flow vector normalization and directional bias logic were tested against a wide range of configurations

---

## Explorations and Experiments

### Key Exploration Areas

#### 1. Performance and scalability

The simulation is able to run on large voxel grids without major slowdowns. Memory usage and erosion logic are efficient enough for 3D resolutions up to 100√ó100√ó50.

#### 2. Geometry variations

Soap shapes such as ellipsoids, cuboids, and cylinders were tested. Curved surfaces erode more evenly, while sharp edges persist longer due to lower directional exposure.

#### 3. Water drop configurations

Different flow vectors (top-down, side, angled) show distinct erosion patterns. GIF animations confirm that flow direction aligns with visual erosion behavior.

#### 4. Non-steady-state configurations

Certain combinations of flow vector and water source height fail to erode the entire bar. Debugging revealed these cases are due to the source point starting inside the soap, which was fixed by computing a better upstream offset.

#### 5. Material property tuning

Different erosion rates and stochastic parameters affect erosion speed and visual smoothness. High variance in stochastic erosion creates more chaotic, jagged surfaces.

---

## Summary

This project was built as a modular, physically inspired erosion simulator. It mirrors many of the data structures, simplifications, and tools found in real nuclear simulation codes. Both deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches were implemented and evaluated. The model was verified using visual debugging tools, mass loss logs, and a wide variety of flow configurations.
