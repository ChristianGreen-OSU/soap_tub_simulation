"""
This module defines the voxel-based geometry representation of the soap bar.
It is used throughout the simulation to hold the 3D grid data structure
representing the soap, where each voxel can represent soap presence (binary)
or local soap density (float).

Plans:
- Represent the soap bar as a 3D numpy array.
- Allow initialization of standard shapes (cube, cylinder, ellipsoid).
- Provide helper functions to:
    - Access surface voxels (for erosion algorithms).
    - Compute total mass and surface area.
    - Optionally assign material properties per voxel.
- This abstraction will be updated in-place by the erosion engine.
- Later, this can be extended to load real 3D mesh data or support unstructured grids.

Nuclear Engineering Parallel:
This mimics how reactor geometry is spatially discretized into lattices or
meshes in codes like OpenMC or Serpent. Each voxel here is like a fuel pin or
cell in a core simulator.
